          <strong>Angel Rosario</strong><br> started "The Auto Surpreme" with one thing in mind, to give everyone the best service around! 
          He's been working in the sales business for 20 years and continues to leanr and grow as he builds on his knowledge. 
          There is a misconception that car salesman are bad people and are just looking for a pay day. 
          Angel at The Auto Surpreme is here to change that misconception and show that a car salesamn can be a caring person.

          <strong>At the age of 18</strong><br> Angel bought his first car from a used car dealer. 
          The dealer knew he didn't know what he was doing and he took full advantage of it. 
          Angel began hearming more and more about how salesman were selling people cars without caring for the person.
          This is when he decided to change that and took up a career in sales, all to make sure people are getting the cars they truly deserve!
